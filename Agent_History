To get information about SQL Server jobs, including their active/inactive status, creation date, owner, and schedule, you can query the system tables in the msdb database. Here is a SQL query that retrieves this information:

sql
Copy code
USE msdb;
GO

SELECT 
    j.name AS JobName,
    CASE 
        WHEN j.enabled = 1 THEN 'Active'
        ELSE 'Inactive'
    END AS JobStatus,
    j.date_created AS DateCreated,
    l.name AS JobOwner,
    s.name AS ScheduleName,
    CASE 
        WHEN s.enabled = 1 THEN 'Enabled'
        ELSE 'Disabled'
    END AS ScheduleStatus,
    s.frequency_type,
    s.frequency_interval,
    s.frequency_subday_type,
    s.frequency_subday_interval,
    s.frequency_relative_interval,
    s.frequency_recurrence_factor,
    s.active_start_date,
    s.active_end_date,
    s.active_start_time,
    s.active_end_time
FROM 
    sysjobs j
LEFT JOIN 
    sysjobschedules js ON j.job_id = js.job_id
LEFT JOIN 
    sysschedules s ON js.schedule_id = s.schedule_id
LEFT JOIN 
    syslogins l ON j.owner_sid = l.sid
ORDER BY 
    j.name;
Explanation:
sysjobs: Contains information about jobs.
sysjobschedules: Links jobs to their schedules.
sysschedules: Contains information about job schedules.
syslogins: Contains information about SQL Server logins.
Key Columns:
JobName: The name of the job.
JobStatus: Indicates whether the job is active or inactive.
DateCreated: The creation date of the job.
JobOwner: The owner of the job.
ScheduleName: The name of the schedule associated with the job.
ScheduleStatus: Indicates whether the schedule is enabled or disabled.
frequency_type, frequency_interval, frequency_subday_type, frequency_subday_interval, frequency_relative_interval, frequency_recurrence_factor, active_start_date, active_end_date, active_start_time, active_end_time: Detailed scheduling information.
Notes:
frequency_type, frequency_interval, and other schedule columns contain codes that indicate the type and timing of the schedule. You may need to refer to SQL Server documentation to interpret these codes fully.
The sysjobschedules table may contain multiple entries for a single job if the job has multiple schedules.
This query provides a comprehensive view of SQL Server Agent jobs, including their status, creation date, owner, and schedule details.

Any  other information like agent setting properties and who has access to the agent jobs and there errors while running
ChatGPT
To get a more comprehensive overview of SQL Server Agent jobs, including agent settings, job access permissions, and error information, you need to extend your queries to include additional system tables and views. Here are a few separate queries to gather this information:

1. SQL Server Agent Settings
To retrieve SQL Server Agent settings, you can query the sys.configurations and the sys.dm_server_services DMV:

sql
Copy code
-- SQL Server Agent settings
SELECT
    name,
    value_in_use,
    description
FROM
    sys.configurations
WHERE
    name LIKE '%agent%';

-- SQL Server Agent service account and status
SELECT 
    servicename,
    startup_type_desc,
    status_desc,
    last_startup_time,
    service_account
FROM 
    sys.dm_server_services
WHERE 
    servicename = 'SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER)';
2. Job Access Permissions
To retrieve information about who has access to SQL Server Agent jobs, you can query the sys.database_permissions table along with sysjobs and syslogins:

sql
Copy code
USE msdb;
GO

SELECT 
    j.name AS JobName,
    l.name AS PrincipalName,
    p.permission_name AS PermissionType,
    p.state_desc AS PermissionState
FROM 
    sysjobs j
JOIN 
    sys.database_permissions p ON j.job_id = p.major_id
JOIN 
    sys.database_principals l ON p.grantee_principal_id = l.principal_id
ORDER BY 
    j.name, l.name;
3. Job Errors and Execution History
To retrieve job errors and execution history, you can query the sysjobhistory and sysjobs tables:

sql
Copy code
USE msdb;
GO

SELECT 
    j.name AS JobName,
    h.run_status,
    h.run_date,
    h.run_time,
    h.run_duration,
    h.sql_message_id,
    h.sql_severity,
    h.message
FROM 
    sysjobs j
JOIN 
    sysjobhistory h ON j.job_id = h.job_id
WHERE 
    h.run_status <> 1  -- 1 indicates success, so this filters for errors
ORDER BY 
    j.name, h.run_date, h.run_time;
Combining Information in a Comprehensive Query
You can combine information about job status, creation date, owner, schedule, access permissions, and errors into a comprehensive view. Here is an example query that combines some of this information:

sql
Copy code
USE msdb;
GO

SELECT 
    j.name AS JobName,
    CASE 
        WHEN j.enabled = 1 THEN 'Active'
        ELSE 'Inactive'
    END AS JobStatus,
    j.date_created AS DateCreated,
    l.name AS JobOwner,
    s.name AS ScheduleName,
    CASE 
        WHEN s.enabled = 1 THEN 'Enabled'
        ELSE 'Disabled'
    END AS ScheduleStatus,
    l2.name AS PrincipalName,
    p.permission_name AS PermissionType,
    p.state_desc AS PermissionState,
    h.run_status,
    h.run_date,
    h.run_time,
    h.run_duration,
    h.sql_message_id,
    h.sql_severity,
    h.message
FROM 
    sysjobs j
LEFT JOIN 
    sysjobschedules js ON j.job_id = js.job_id
LEFT JOIN 
    sysschedules s ON js.schedule_id = s.schedule_id
LEFT JOIN 
    syslogins l ON j.owner_sid = l.sid
LEFT JOIN 
    sys.database_permissions p ON j.job_id = p.major_id
LEFT JOIN 
    sys.database_principals l2 ON p.grantee_principal_id = l2.principal_id
LEFT JOIN 
    sysjobhistory h ON j.job_id = h.job_id
WHERE 
    h.run_status <> 1  -- Filter for job errors
ORDER BY 
    j.name, l.name;
Explanation:
Job and Schedule Information: This is obtained from sysjobs, sysjobschedules, and sysschedules.
Job Owner: This is retrieved from syslogins.
Permissions: This is joined from sys.database_permissions and sys.database_principals.
Job History and Errors: This is joined from sysjobhistory.
Notes:
Permissions: Only retrieves permissions that have been explicitly granted. You might need to adjust the query to cover other permission types and scenarios.
Errors: The run_status column in sysjobhistory indicates the job outcome, where 0 = Failed, 1 = Succeeded, 2 = Retry, and 3 = Canceled.
This comprehensive query can help you gather detailed information about SQL Server Agent jobs, including their configuration, access permissions, and error history.

SQL Server Agent settings won't  be in sys.configurations is there another query
ChatGPT
You're right. SQL Server Agent settings are not stored in sys.configurations. Instead, they can be found in system tables and procedures specific to SQL Server Agent. Here is a query to gather SQL Server Agent settings:

SQL Server Agent Settings
To retrieve SQL Server Agent settings, you can use the sp_help_alert and sp_help_operator stored procedures, along with querying the msdb.dbo.sysjobs table and related tables:

sql
Copy code
USE msdb;
GO

-- Retrieve SQL Server Agent alert settings
EXEC sp_help_alert;

-- Retrieve SQL Server Agent operator settings
EXEC sp_help_operator;

-- Retrieve SQL Server Agent job settings
SELECT 
    sj.name AS JobName,
    sj.enabled AS JobEnabled,
    sj.description AS JobDescription,
    sj.start_step_id AS StartStepID,
    sj.category_id AS CategoryID,
    sj.owner_sid AS OwnerSID,
    sj.date_created AS DateCreated,
    sj.date_modified AS DateModified,
    s.name AS JobScheduleName,
    CASE 
        WHEN s.enabled = 1 THEN 'Enabled'
        ELSE 'Disabled'
    END AS ScheduleStatus,

    s.freq_recurrence_factor AS FrequencyRecurrenceFactor,
    s.active_start_date AS ActiveStartDate,
    s.active_end_date AS ActiveEndDate,
    s.active_start_time AS ActiveStartTime,
    s.active_end_time AS ActiveEndTime
FROM 
    msdb.dbo.sysjobs AS sj
LEFT JOIN
